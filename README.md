My name is Abigail. I am a junior at the University of Washington studying computer science and music. I'm currently trying to get started on working on personal projects, mainly creating websites since I just wrapped up taking a web programming class at UW.

My main goal, however, is to start tapping into the game development side of computer programming. I absolutely love playing video games, and I really hope that I can become a game developer myself. If anyone is interested in collaborating with me on any sort of game development project you have, please contact me!
